    <section class="article-section">
        <h2>PROLOGUE: THE CLOSED LOOP</h2>

        <p>The sun sets over Victoria County not on a government of the people, but on a "Franchise." In the humid
            silence of Sector 77901, the machinery of justice hums, but it doesn't produce justice. It produces stats.
            It produces revenue. And most importantly, it produces silence.</p>

        <p>To understand why a deputy like Travis Campbell acts with impunity on the side of a highway—why he feels safe
            choking a citizen in front of a Ring camera—you have to understand the shadow cast by the courthouse. You
            have to understand the family tree that holds the gavel.</p>

        <h3>The January 1, 2025 Transition</h3>
        <p>On New Year's Day, 2025, the circuit was completed. There was no fanfare, just the quiet clicking of a lock
            engaging. When **Lisa Harvey Moore** was sworn in for her four-year term as the 24th District Judge, she
            wasn't just taking an oath; she was assuming the management of a legacy.</p>
        <p>This wasn't a standard democratic transition. It was a corporate handover.</p>
        <p>**Jack W. Marr**, the outgoing judge and father of the current Sheriff, had held the seat for over a decade.
            He didn't pass the torch to a rival, or a reformer, or even a stranger. He passed it to his former law
            partner. For nineteen years, Moore and Marr had shared a letterhead at "Marr, Meier & Hartman." Now, they
            share the fate of every defendant in the county.</p>

        <h3>The Legacy Asset</h3>
        <p>This transition ensured that the 24th District Court remained what it has always been: a "Legacy Asset" of
            the Marr family business.</p>
        <p>In a functioning democracy, the Executive Branch (Sheriff **Justin Marr**) and the Judicial Branch (Judge
            Moore) are separated by checks and balances. In Victoria, they are bound by decades of shared financial
            interest, summer barbecues, and the unspoken loyalty of a closed system.</p>
        <p>This is the face of **Systemic Authoritarianism**. It doesn't look like a boot stamping on a human face; it
            looks like a polite handshake between old friends while the jail fills up.</p>

        <h3>The Vertical Monopoly</h3>
        <p>In this system, the "Political Veil" is a business model.</p>
        <p><strong>The Arrest:</strong> Sheriff Justin Marr controls the "Executive" entry point. His deputies
            (Campbell, Patterson) generate the volume needed to fuel the Federal and State grants.</p>
        <p><strong>The Judgment:</strong> Judge Lisa Harvey Moore controls the "Judicial" exit point. As the "Legacy
            Proxy," her role is to ensure that the Sheriff’s operations face minimal friction in the courtroom.</p>
        <p>If a citizen is abused by one of Justin Marr's deputies, their only path to justice leads directly to the
            former business partner of the Sheriff's father. It is a vertical monopoly on freedom, where the law firm
            that built the system now presides over its defense.</p>

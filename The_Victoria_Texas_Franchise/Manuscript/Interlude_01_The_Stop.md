# INTERLUDE I: THE STOP

**23:14 HOURS. HIGHWAY 59 NORTH.**

You are driving home. The air conditioner is humming, a low drone against the humid Texas night. You are thinking about rent. You are thinking about the leak in the roof. You are not thinking about your license plate light.

Then, the world turns blue.

It isn't a light; it is a physical force. The strobe hits your rearview mirror with the violence of a strobe light in a dark room. Your heart does that thing—that skipping, lurching thud—even though you haven't done anything. You tap the brakes. You pull over to the gravel shoulder. The gravel crunches, loud and harsh, sounding like bones breaking under tires.

**THE APPROACH**
You roll down the window. The humidity punches you in the face.
You don't see a person. You see a silhouette backlit by a blinding LED sun.
You see the shape of a hat. The bulk of a vest. The shadow of a hand resting near a holster.

"DRIVER. WINDOW."

The voice isn't asking. It is commanding. It is a voice calibrated to bypass your logic and hit your reptile brain.
You fumble for your wallet. Your hands are shaking. Why are they shaking? You didn't steal anything. You aren't drunk.
"Keep your hands on the wheel!"

The contradiction hits you. Get your ID. Keep your hands on the wheel. It is a logic trap. A test you are designed to fail.

**THE SNIFF**
He is at the window now. You smell it before you see him. Gun oil. Starch. And something else—adrenaline. He is amped. He is breathing hard, like he just ran a sprint, even though he just walked ten feet.
He shines the flashlight directly into your eyes. You squint, blinded.
"Where are you coming from?"
"Work."
"Work at 11 PM?"
"I pull double shifts."
"You look nervous. You got anything in the car I need to know about? Guns? Knives? Bazookas?"

He laughs. It isn't a funny laugh. It's a hunting laugh. He is looking past you, scanning the backseat, looking for a reason. He needs a reason. He needs a "Hit."

**THE CONVERSION**
You realize, with a sinking cold in your stomach, that you are not a citizen right now. You are an opportunity.
If he finds a seed, it's possession.
If he finds cash, it's laundering.
If you stutter, it's "Suspicious Behavior."
If you pull away when he reaches in, it's "Resisting."

You are not on the side of the road. You are on a conveyor belt. And the machine at the end of it needs to be fed.

"Step out of the vehicle."

The lock clicks.
The door opens.
The Franchise is open for business.

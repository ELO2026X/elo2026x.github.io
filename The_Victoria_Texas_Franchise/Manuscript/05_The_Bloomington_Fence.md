# CHAPTER 5: THE BLOOMINGTON FENCE

Spoliation—the destruction of evidence—is usually a quiet act. A deleted email. A shredded document. But in Victoria County, spoliation cost **$112,000** and required a construction crew.

## The Account 59 Expenditures
In late 2025, just as federal scrutiny intensified, the Sheriff's Office authorized a massive expenditure from "Account 59" (The Asset Forfeiture Fund). This account, legally designated for law enforcement equipment to fight crime, was redirected to fight transparency.

**The Project:** A high-security, opaque perimeter fence around the Sheriff's substation in Bloomington, Texas.

## The Architecture of Paranoia
Why Bloomington? And why now?
Bloomington is a remote outpost. It sits miles away from the prying eyes of the downtown courthouse and the diligent lenses of local activists. Forensic intelligence indicates that this facility has been repurposed. It is no longer just a substation; it is a **"Spoliation Safehouse."**

*   **The Problem:** The main Evidence Locker in Victoria is unsafe. It is under digital surveillance (the "Civil Shield" project) and legal scrutiny. The "Error 0x800" failure proved that digital deletion is risky.
*   **The Solution:** Move physical assets—seized vehicles, uncatalogued property, paper files—to a location where the only law is the lock on the gate.

## The Fortress
The fence is not there to keep criminals out; it is there to keep *us* out.
By hardening the perimeter of the Bloomington substation, the Sheriff created a "Black Site" for physical evidence. Construction records show the timeline aligns perfectly with the "Panic Meetings" of January 2026.
*   **January 8:** The Trevino Shooting creates a massive liability.
*   **January 20:** The "Settlement" talks begin in secret.
*   **Late January:** The walls go up in Bloomington.

This $112,000 expenditure is not infrastructure. It is obstruction of justice paid for with the very money they seized from the citizens they are hiding from. It is a monument to their fear.

# THE VICTORIA LEXICON
**Terms of Control in Sector 77901**

**Aggressor Element**
*noun.* A law enforcement officer who initiates conflict without probable cause to generate "Resisting" charges. Characterized by the use of "Tactical Escalation" and "Gaslighting" (e.g., redefining a chokehold as a "side hug"). See *Chapter 8*.

**Docket Stasis**
*noun.* The deliberate slowing or freezing of a criminal case to maintain leverage over a defendant. Used primarily on "Assets" (Violent Offenders) to compel cooperation as Confidential Informants. Contrast with *Velocity*. See *Chapter 6*.

**Legacy Asset**
*noun.* A public office (Judicial or Executive) inherited or transferred between business partners rather than democratically elected. The "Marr Dynasty" (Judge Jack Marr to Judge Lisa Harvey Moore) is the primary example. See *Chapter 1*.

**Pseudo-Felony**
*noun.* A minor infraction (e.g., traffic violation) inflated into a felony charge (e.g., Smuggling, Evading) through data manipulation or pretextual questioning. The primary fuel for the "Operation Lone Star" grant engine. See *Chapter 2*.

**Simulacrum Arrest**
*noun.* A retaliatory arrest that mimics a legitimate law enforcement action but lacks criminal intent or probable cause. Deployed specifically against political dissidents, whistleblowers, or civil plaintiffs immediately following a legal filing. See *Chapter 7*.

**Spoliation Safehouse**
*noun.* A physical location (e.g., The Bloomington Substation) used to store evidence or assets outside of the standard chain of custody and digital surveillance grid, ostensibly to prevent "Discovery" or "Federal Audit." See *Chapter 5*.

**Velocity**
*noun.* The speed at which a defendant is processed through the judicial system. Political Targets experience "Hyper-Velocity" (Indictment in days), while Assets experience "Stasis" (Delays of years). See *Chapter 6*.

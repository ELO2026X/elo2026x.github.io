# INTERLUDE II: THE HANDSHAKE

**NOVEMBER 2024. THE PUMP HOUSE RESTAURANT.**

The steak is medium-rare. The wine is a terrifyingly expensive Cabernet.
The noise of the restaurant—clinking silverware, the low murmur of oil deals—fades into the background. At the corner booth, two people are dissecting the future of a county.

**Jack Marr** looks tired. Not the tired of a man who has worked too hard, but the tired of a man who has held a heavy door open for too long. He wipes his mouth with a linen napkin.
"It's turnkey, Lisa. That's what you need to understand. It's not a judgeship. It's a machine."

**Lisa Harvey Moore** nods. She doesn't take notes. She knows the firm's history better than she knows her own children. Nineteen years at *Marr, Meier & Hartman*. Nineteen years of learning where the bodies are buried, and more importantly, how to draft the paperwork to keep them there.

"Justin is going to need cover," Jack says. He refers to his son, the Sheriff, not as an elected official, but as a liability that needs insurance. "He pushes the line. You know that. He needs the docket to move fast on the nuisances and slow on the earners."

"The earners," Lisa repeats.
"The CIs. The dealers. The ones who keep the grant numbers up. Don't let them flush out too early. Reset them. Keep them on the leash."

She takes a sip of wine.
"And the nuisances?"
"The loud ones. The ones with the cameras. The ones quoting the Constitution like it's a menu. Bury them."

Jack reaches across the table. It isn't a hug. It isn't emotional. It is the closing of a deal.
"I built the house, Lisa. You just have to change the locks."

They shake hands.
Outside, the air is thick with humidity and silence. The transition is complete. The voters think they are electing a judge. They are just renewing the lease.

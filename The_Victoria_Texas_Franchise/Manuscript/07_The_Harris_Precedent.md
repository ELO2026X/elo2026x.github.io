# CHAPTER 7: THE HARRIS PRECEDENT

In Victoria County, the legal system does not debate its critics. It arrests them.
This tactic is not improvised; it is a standardized, industrial procedure. We call it the **"Simulacrum Arrest."**
In philosophy, a simulacrum is a copy without an original. In Sector 77901, it is a charge without a crime.

## The Patient Zero: Anna Harris
The precedent was established in 2021 with Anna Harris, a local activist who dared to criticize the judiciary on TikTok.
*   **The Action:** Harris filed a Federal Civil Rights lawsuit against the Sheriff and District Attorney for violating her First Amendment rights. She touched the third rail.
*   **The Reaction:** On the **exact same day** she filed her federal suit, she was arrested by Sheriff's Deputies.
*   **The Charge:** "Littering" and "Failure to Signal."

This was the warning shot. When a citizen attempts to use the Federal Courts—the mechanism designed to check local power—the local power responds with kinetic force.

## The Escalation Protocol
When the petty charges failed to silence her, the system escalated. The "Franchise" does not tolerate survivors. They dug into her past, found a discrepancy in her educational claims, and indicted her for **"Aggravated Perjury."**

They turned a civil dispute into a felony record. They detained her, drained her resources, and forced her to fight for her liberty instead of her rights. This is the **"Attrition Model."** They know they might not win in court, but they will win in the bank account. They will bankrupt you into silence.

## The Playbook: Retaliation as Policy
This is the manual being used against every dissident in Sector 77901.
1.  **Identify the Threat:** Anyone filing a Grievance, a Federal Suit, or a Public Information Request.
2.  **The "Simulacrum":** Find a technicality. A forgotten ticket. A generic "Disorderly Conduct." A "Resisting" charge for asking a question.
3.  **The Timing:** Execute the arrest immediately after the citizen takes legal action. This sends a clear signal to the community: *We can touch you.*

## The Application to Ortiz
The ongoing prosecution of the Author is a carbon copy — a simulacrum — of the Harris case. The charges are not based on criminal intent; they are based on strategic necessity. The system needs the Author to be a "Defendant" so that he cannot be a "Plaintiff."

But the Harris Precedent proves one thing: This is not about the law. It is about **Retaliation**. And in a Federal Court, retaliation is evidence of Bad Faith. The Franchise is betting that they can crush the resistance before the Feds arrive. They are wrong.

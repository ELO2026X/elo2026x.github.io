# BOOK DOSSIER: THE OPERATIVES
**Project:** The Closed Circuit
**Subject:** High-Value Targets (HVT) Analysis

## TARGET A: DEPUTY TRAVIS CAMPBELL (The "Enforcer")
**Role:** Patrol Deputy / "Jump Out" Boy
**The Persona:** Aggressive, Escalatory, "Pseudo-Felony" Specialist.
**Key Incidents:**
1.  **The "Ring Camera" Raid (May 16, 2025):**
    *   **Action:** Campbell approached a residence without a warrant, escalating a "Civil Standby" into a confrontation.
    *   **The "Side Hug" Lie:** Claimed he used a "side hug" to restrain a subject. Video evidence proves he used a **Full Nelson / Chokehold**.
    *   **Motive:** Intimidation. The "Bitch Ass" element refers to his reliance on badge authority to bully citizens while fearing actual accountability.
2.  **The "Up-Code" Specialist:** Campbell is often the arresting officer in cases where minor infractions (Traffic) are elevated to Felonies (Evading, Resisting, Smuggling) to meet Grant Quotas.

## TARGET B: INVESTIGATOR STEVEN NELSON (The "Cleaner")
**Role:** Investigator / Internal Affairs Proxy
**The Persona:** Bureaucratic, Dismissive, "Gaslighter."
**Key Function:**
*   **The "Dead End" Desk:** When citizens file complaints against deputies (like Campbell), Nelson is the one who "investigates."
*   **The Whitewash:** His reports invariably find "No Policy Violation." He is the *insulation* that protects the Sheriff/Deputies from liability.
*   **Methodology:** Gaslighting victims by claiming "body cams malfunctioned" or "interpretations differ."

## TARGET C: CORPORAL PATTERSON (The "Soldier")
**Role:** Supervisor / Field Commander
**The Persona:** The "Company Man."
**Key Function:**
*   **Enforcing the Quota:** Patterson ensures the deputies (like Campbell) are hitting their numbers ("Contacts," "Stops," "Arrests") to justify the Operation Lone Star overtime.
*   **The "Good Cop" Mask:** Often plays the "reasonable" supervisor while enabling the aggression of his subordinates.

## TARGET D: SHERIFF JUSTIN MARR (The "CEO")
**Role:** Sheriff of Victoria County
**The Persona:** The "Dynasty Heir."
**Key Function:**
*   **The Grant Farmer:** His primary job is not law enforcement; it is **Revenue Generation** via State Grants (OLS).
*   **The Closed Circuit:** He arrests them, and his father's law partner (Judge Moore) judges them. It is a perfect, closed loop of profit.
